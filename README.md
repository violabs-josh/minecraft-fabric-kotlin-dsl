# Minecraft Fabric Kotlin DSL

The Fabric API is great, but I wanted a bit more of a DSL enforcement for creating mods.
This attempts to do so, while learning the framework itself.

Currently, this will remain in a working state. I will build this using the provided
tutorials, but mix in my DSL. If this gets to a working state, I can move the examples out.
